cove-yurt is a version of COVE (see http://cove.ocean.washington.edu/) being developed for insightful visualization of oceanographic data in a CAVE (computer-assisted visualization environment), initially the Yurt CAVE at Brown University. cove-yurt and COVE share a common XML Schema in order that content developed in a COVE desktop environment can be shared in a virtual reality theater in stereo with other viewers.

COVE (and cove-yurt) are open source code bases and as such are always wanting to be improved by interested collaborators. We are particularly interested in collaborators who are supporting scientists to see scientific data rendered in compelling ways for analysis and hypothesis forming. Please consider downloading the COVE application from http://cove.ocean.washington.edu/ (also see the gallery) and exploring the various examples of ocean data visualization products that have been developed using the application.
